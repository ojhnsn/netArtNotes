# Data
Low to High Level Code
- Binary Code lowest level of code
- Assembly abstraction of binary
- C
- C++
- Java
- Python
- Maxmsp high level of code

Learning low level to uncoventionally think about data and better understand it

- arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
- decimal
- base 10

roman numerals I V X C M L

numbers are code

- binary 0 1
- base 2
- 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
- 1   0  0  1  1 1 0 1=157
- 1 translates to bit
- series of 8 bits - bytes
- 255 is largest in binary
- represents voltage running through computer

digital world has a finite quantity

- hex 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
- base 16
- FF=255

- 11111111-byte in binary
- FF-byte in hex
- 255-byte in base 10

store data on non volitle media when turned off

CPU-central processing unit does all the math by processing data

GPU-graphic processing unit
data is stored in RAM
hard drive stores data as non volitile storage

ASCII translates binary to letters original
Unicode current way to decode
metadata is data about the data
beginning of media files is called header with metadata and body is raw data
